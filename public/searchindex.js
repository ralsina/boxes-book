to Boxes v1. I want to be able to draw some boxes. By boxes I don't mean actual boxes, but rather squares. I found a library called svgwrite that lets you do that pretty easily. First let's create a data structure. A simple class called Box. # lesson1.py\nclass Box(): def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1): \"\"\"Accept arguments to define our box, and store them.\"\"\" self.x = x self.y = y self.w = w self.h = h def __repr__(self): return 'Box(%s, %s, %s, %s)' % (self.x, self.y, self.w, self.y) As you can see that is a pretty simple class.

One first approach, which we will refine later, is to simply refuse to break lines if we are not in a \"good\" place to break it. Then, we inject a box with a visible hyphen in the linebreak, and that's it. Here is the code to create a box with a hyphen: # lesson10.py\ndef hyphenbox(): b = Box(letter='-') adjust_widths_by_letter([b]) return b And here finally, our layout supports hyphens: # lesson10.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .05 def layout(_boxes): \"\"\"Layout boxes along pages.

Instead of stretching out a \"underfilled\" line, we are squeezing a \"overfilled\" one. Everything gets packed too tight, and the letters start overlapping one another. The lesson is that just because it works for the usual case it doesn't mean it's done . Even in the case of words, it can happen that breaking points take a while to appear and our line becomes overfull. We will tackle that problem next.

Some of my most fun projects were created because I was doing the equivalent of doodling on a computer. Sometimes, it starts with a post on a blog, or a link on twitter, and I just think \"hmmm, I wonder how that's done\" or \"well, that sounds fun to write\" or \"that doesn't look so hard!\" (those usually are so hard.) So, I doodle on the interpreter, or in a throwaway script file. No tests, no requirements, no fuzz.

White space at the beginning of rows is shown and it looks bad lesson8.svg You can see clearly, in the previous sample output where this happens in one of the latter paragraphs, \"to see the place, \" appears ragged when it should not. And a similar thing happens in an earlier paragraph where there is a hole against the left margin in \" told me all about it\". In both cases, the cause is because the \"empty\" space is used by spaces! So, one possible solution is, when justifying a row, to make all the spaces at the right margins 0-width and not stretchy. At the same time, when adding spaces at the beginning of a row, they should become 0-width and not stretchy. BUT this means the list of boxes will need its width readjusted if they are to be layouted again on different pages! That's because some of the spaces will now be thin and \"rigid\" so they will work badly if they are not against the margin on a different layout. It's not a big problem, but it's worth keeping in mind, since it's the kind of thing that becomes an obscure bug later on.

But we cheated. To achieve full justification, we spread the \"slack\" evenly in the space between all boxes in the row. If we were trying to layout text, that is not the proper way. You see, text comes separated in words. And usually, in western languages, the words have characters called spaces between them. So what we do, when laying out text, is to make the special space boxes slightly larger and keep the separation between boxes constant (in fact, we also tweak separations between letters, but let's ignore that for now. Or for ever. How about we choose some boxes and decide they, and only they, are stretchy?

You need to understand the content of the font you are using to display the text, and more subtle things like what happens if you put specific letters next to each other (kerning) and much more. The good news is that it's already done for us, in libraries called Harfbuzz and Freetype. This paragraph is perhaps the most important one in this book. I am about to show you some obscure code. And I will tell you the secret of how it got here: I copied it from the documentation for the libraries I am using. Sometimes you will need to do something complicated only once in your life. It's perfectly ok to just google how to do it. And as long as you are confident you can find it again if needed, it's ok to just forget about it. I will show you this code, and then put it in a separate file called fonts.py and from now on I will not show it in the lessons, because we are not going to change it, ever . # fonts.py\nimport harfbuzz as hb\nimport freetype2 as ft def adjust_widths_by_letter(boxes): \"\"\"Takes a list of boxes as arguments, and uses harfbuzz to adjust the width of each box to match the harfbuzz text shaping.\"\"\" buf = hb.Buffer.create() buf.add_str(''.join(b.letter for b in boxes)) buf.guess_segment_properties() font_lib = ft.get_default_lib() face = font_lib.find_face('Arial') face.set_char_size(size=1, resolution=64) font = hb.Font.ft_create(face) hb.shape(font, buf) # at this point buf.glyph_positions has all the data we need for box, position in zip(boxes, buf.glyph_positions): box.w = position.x_advance And now we will pretend we know what that does, based on its docstring and use it. # lesson7.py\nfrom code import fonts separation = .05\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson7_adjusted_letters.svg', (30, 20)) lesson7_adjusted_letters.svg And nicer, without the boxes: # lesson7.py\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes( text_boxes, 'lesson7_adjusted_letters_no_boxes.svg', (30, 20), hide_boxes=True,\n) lesson7_adjusted_letters_no_boxes.svg And of course, we can just load text there instead of random letters. For example, here we load what is going to be our example test from now on, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice from Project Gutenberg # lesson7.py\np_and_p = open('pride-and-prejudice.txt').read()\ntext_boxes = []\nfor l in p_and_p: text_boxes.append(Box(letter=l, stretchy=l == ' '))\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes( text_boxes, 'lesson7_pride_and_prejudice.svg', (30, 20), hide_boxes=True,\n) lesson7_pride_and_prejudice.svg And that is ... maybe disappointing? While we spent a lot of time on things like justifying text, we have not even looked at newlines! Also, spaces at the end of lines make the line appear ragged again, now that they are not boxes.

Here is the image of our attempt at displaying \"Pride and Prejudice\": lesson7_pride_and_prejudice.svg Let's count the problems: It totally ignores newlines everywhere It keeps spaces at the end of rows, making the right side ragged (see \"said his \" in the seventh line) White space at the beginning of rows is shown and it looks bad (see \" a neigh\" at the beginning of the fifth line) Words are split between lines haphazardly, but this is for later and leads to some serious code that needs its own lesson. Let's hit the issues in order. First, newlines. The idea is: if we find a newline, we need to break the line. Doesn't sound particularly complex, specially since lines that are broken intentionally are never fully justified. The changes are minor: Create a flag break_line set to True if we encounter a newline or overflow the page. In case of newline, make that box invisible by making it 0-wide and not stretchy. When the break_line flag is set, handle as usual by moving to the left, etc. # lesson8.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .05 def layout(_boxes): # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy boxes = _boxes[:] # We start at page 0 page = 0 # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page previous = boxes.pop(0) previous.x = pages[page].x previous.y = pages[page].y row = [] while boxes: # We take the new 1st box box = boxes.pop(0) # And put it next to the other box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation # At the same vertical location box.y = previous.y # Handle breaking on newlines break_line = False # But if it's a newline if (box.letter == '\\n'): break_line = True # Newlines take no horizontal space ever box.w = 0 box.stretchy = False # Or if it's too far to the right... elif (box.x + box.w) > (pages[page].x + pages[page].w): break_line = True # We adjust the row slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - ( row[-1].x + row[-1].w ) # Get a list of all the ones that are stretchy stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy] if not stretchies: # Nothing stretches do as before. bump = slack / len(row) # The 1st box gets 0 bumps, the 2nd gets 1 and so on for i, b in enumerate(row): b.x += bump * i else: bump = slack / len(stretchies) # Each stretchy gets wider for b in stretchies: b.w += bump # And we put each thing next to the previous one for j, b in enumerate(row[1:], 1): b.x = row[j - 1].x + row[j - 1].w + separation if break_line: # We start a new row row = [] # We go all the way left and a little down box.x = pages[page].x box.y = previous.y + previous.h + separation # But if we go too far down if box.y + box.h > pages[page].y + pages[page].h: # We go to the next page page += 1 # And put the box at the top-left box.x = pages[page].x box.y = pages[page].y # Put the box in the row row.append(box) previous = box layout(text_boxes) The code changes are small, but the output now looks radically different. # lesson8.py\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson8.svg', (30, 50), hide_boxes=True) lesson8.svg Further references: Full source code for this lesson lesson8.py Difference with code from last lesson","breadcrumbs":"Part 1 » BOXES v8"},"lesson11.run.html#underfull-and-overfull":{"title":"Underfull and Overfull","breadcrumbs":"Part 1 » Underfull and Overfull","id":"lesson11.run.html#underfull-and-overfull","body":"When a line has too few characters, slack is positive and we have to \"spread\" them, that is called underfull . The opposite, where a line has too many characters, slack is negative and we have to \"smush\" them, is called overfull . lesson10_one_break.svg So far, our algorithm to break lines is simple: If the next character is a newline: break If we are short, add to the line. If the next character makes the line overfull: a. If it's a space or a hyphen: break b. If not, add to the line If we broke the line, adjust positions and widths so the line is exactly as wide as the page by spreading the slack. We need a better way to decide what is the best possible breaking point for the line. If it's too overfull, it will look bad. If it's too underfull, it will look bad too. And sometimes there is just no good breaking point and we need to do something . If we were lucky enough to have a breaking point that exactly fills the line, then we would not have a problem, so usually this will come down to choosing between two breaking points. One makes the line overfull, one keeps it underfull. How good is a breaking point? If the slack is smaller, it's better. If it's underfull it's slightly better than overfull, since it's better to have a spread out line than overlapping letters. If we have many spaces, then a bigger slack is acceptable. This is all subjective, of course. How much movement we tolerate on the text is a judgment call, so it involves some trial and error. Let's start with some made up numbers, because we have to start somewhere. The allowed positive slack is 20% of the width of the spaces in the line. The allowed negative slack is 10% of the width of the spaces in the line. And here's a plan to implement it: When adding characters, check if it's a possible breaking point. If it is, remember the \"goodness\" it has When reaching an overfull breaking point, check if it's better than the last one we saw. If the overfull breaking point is better, break.

But only when those boxes are all alike. Once the boxes had different widths, the right side of our layout got all ragged. You surely have seen things like it when using word processors or reading web pages, where the text is all aligned on the left and all ragged on the right. It's called a \"left-aligned\" or \"ragged-right\" layout. The reason is that we exceed the page width by a random amount, and then, when moving that box to the next row, we are left a random amount short of the desired width. Could we make it look aligned on BOTH sides? Of course. Let's try. This code is just like before: # lesson5.py\nclass Box(): def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1): \"\"\"Accept arguments to define our box, and store them.\"\"\" self.x = x self.y = y self.w = w self.h = h def __repr__(self): return 'Box(%s, %s, %s, %s)' % (self.x, self.y, self.w, self.y) # Many boxes with varying widths\nfrom random import randint many_boxes = [Box(w=1 + randint(-5, 5) / 10) for i in range(5000)] # A few pages all the same size\npages = [Box(i * 35, 0, 30, 50) for i in range(10)] And of course, we need a new layout function. The plan is this: Organize boxes in rows, like before. When we are about to go too wide, see how much \"slack\" is left between the right side of our last box in the row and the edge of the page.

It has many problems, but remember our goal is not to create the best possible thing, this is an educational experience. The spit and polish will appear later on. But there is a glaring problem, it breaks words in all the wrong places. Examples of it appear in almost every line of the output. So, how does one fix that? The traditional answer (and the one we will be using) is hyphenation, breaking words between lines in the correct places. Instead of breaking anywhere, we will break only in the places where the rules of each language allow us to. Just as it happened with text shaping we are lucky to live in a moment in time when almost everything we need to do it right is already in place. In particular, we will use a library called Pyphen mostly because I already have used it in another project. Am I sure it's the best one? No. Do I know exactly how it does what it does? No. I know enough to make it work, and it works well enough so for this stage in the life of this project that is more than enough.

It even supports subtleties such as the differences betwen British and American English!
