It has many problems, but remember our goal is not to create the best possible thing, this is an educational experience. The spit and polish will appear later on. But there is a glaring problem, it breaks words in all the wrong places. Examples of it appear in almost every line of the output. So, how does one fix that? The traditional answer (and the one we will be using) is hyphenation, breaking words between lines in the correct places. Instead of breaking anywhere, we will break only in the places where the rules of each language allow us to. Just as it happened with text shaping we are lucky to live in a moment in time when almost everything we need to do it right is already in place. In particular, we will use a library called Pyphen mostly because I already have used it in another project. Am I sure it's the best one? No. Do I know exactly how it does what it does? No. I know enough to make it work, and it works well enough so for this stage in the life of this project that is more than enough. In fact, it takes the rules for word-breaking from dictionaries provided by an Office Suite, so it does about as good a job as the dictionary does. It even supports subtleties such as the differences between British and American English! Here's an example of how it works: import pyphen\ndic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en_GB')\nprint('en_GB:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-'))\ndic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en_US')\nprint('en_US:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-')) en_GB: dic-tion-ary\nen_US: dic-tio-nary Keep in mind that this is not magic. If you feed it garbage, it will give you garbage. dic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='es_ES')\nprint('es_ES:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-')) es_ES: dic-tio-na-ry Where is it proper to break a line? On a newline character On a space On a breaking point as defined by Pyphen One of those things is not like the others. We have boxes with newlines in them and we have boxes with spaces in them, but there are no boxes with breaking points in them. But we can add them! There is Unicode symbol for that:","id":"part1/lesson10.run.html#boxes-v010"},"part1/lesson11.run.html#underfull-and-overfull":{"title":"Underfull and Overfull","body":"When a line has too few characters, slack is positive and we have to \"spread\" them, that is called underfull .

If the next character makes the line overfull: a. If it's a space or a hyphen: break b. If not, add to the line If we broke the line, adjust positions and widths so the line is exactly as wide as the page by spreading the slack. We need a better way to decide what is the best possible breaking point for the line. If it's too overfull, it will look bad. If it's too underfull, it will look bad too. And sometimes there is just no good breaking point and we need to do something . If we were lucky enough to have a breaking point that exactly fills the line, then we would not have a problem, so usually this will come down to choosing between two breaking points. One makes the line overfull, one keeps it underfull. How good is a breaking point? If the slack is smaller, it's better. If it's underfull it's slightly better than overfull, since it's better to have a spread out line than overlapping letters. If we have many spaces, then a bigger slack is acceptable. This is all subjective, of course. How much movement we tolerate on the text is a judgment call, so it involves some trial and error. Let's start with some made up numbers, because we have to start somewhere. The allowed positive slack is 20% of the width of the spaces in the line. The allowed negative slack is 10% of the width of the spaces in the line. And here's a plan to implement it: When adding characters, check if it's a possible breaking point. If it is, remember the \"goodness\" it has When reaching an overfull breaking point, check if it's better than the last one we saw. If the overfull breaking point is better, break. If the overfull breaking point is worse, use the underfull breaking point. The first new thing is a function to calculate how good a breaking point is, in those terms. # lesson11.py\ndef badness(page_width, row): \"\"\"Calculate how 'bad' a position to break is. bigger is worse. \"\"\" # Yes, this is suboptimal. It's easier to optimize working code # than fixing fast code. row_width = (row[-1].x + row[-1].w) - row[0].x slack = page_width - row_width stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy] if len(stretchies) > 0: stretchies_width = sum(s.w for s in stretchies) # More stetchy space is good. More slack is bad. badness = slack / stretchies_width else: # Nothing to stretch. Not good. badness = 1000 if slack < 0: # Arbitrary fudge factor, negative slack is THIS much worse badness *= 2 return badness # 10 boxes of width 1, 1 stretchy in the middle\nboxes = [Box(x=i, w=1) for i in range(10)]\nboxes[5].stretchy = True # On a page that is 8 units wide:\nprint(badness(8, boxes)) -4.0 Let's see how that works for page widths between 5 and 15 (remember our row is 10 units wide): for w in range(5,15): print('page_width:', w, ' -> badness:', badness(w, boxes)) As you can see, if the page was 10 units wide, it would be optimal. The second best option is for the page to be slightly wider, then maybe slightly thinner and so on. page_width: 5 -> badness: -10.0\npage_width: 6 -> badness: -8.0\npage_width: 7 -> badness: -6.0\npage_width: 8 -> badness: -4.0\npage_width: 9 -> badness: -2.0\npage_width: 10 -> badness: 0.0\npage_width: 11 -> badness: 1.0\npage_width: 12 -> badness: 2.0\npage_width: 13 -> badness: 3.0\npage_width: 14 -> badness: 4.0 We will need to load data that shows the problem. In this case, it's a row of 20 letters 'a' (without hyphens), a space, then 20, and then 30 more 'a's. Why? Like before, the page is about wide enough to fix 58 \"a\"s. That means the first run will not be enough to fill the line. The second run will still not be enough. The third run will, however, badly overfill it. So, we should go all the way to the end, see that it's too long, and then go back to the second space and break there. # lesson11.py\n# Three runs of \"a\" with spaces between them.\n# The ideal breaking point is the second space.\ntext_boxes = [Box(letter='a') for a in range(72)]\nfor i in (20, 50): text_boxes[i].letter = ' ' text_boxes[i].stretchy = True\nadjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes) # A few pages all the same size\npages = [Box(i * 35, 0, 30, 50) for i in range(10)] And now we have a problem. The change to our code needed to implement that is too large. It's so large that it amounts to a rewrite of our layout function and if we rewrite it, how would we be sure that we are not breaking all the things we achieved previously? It turns out this is as far as just sitting down and writing code will take us. We need to get more serious, and transform this small pile of fragile code into something we can actually hack confidently and transform without fear of destroying it. Therefore, we leave layout intact, show the failing test and move on to Part 2 of the book, where we will reorganize the code into a coherent software package and then... we will try again. # lesson11.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .05 def layout(_boxes): \"\"\"Layout boxes along pages.

But we cheated. To achieve full justification, we spread the \"slack\" evenly in the space between all boxes in the row. If we were trying to layout text, that is not the proper way. You see, text comes separated in words. And usually, in western languages, the words have characters called spaces between them. So what we do, when laying out text, is to make the special space boxes slightly larger and keep the separation between boxes constant (in fact, we also tweak separations between letters, but let's ignore that for now. Or for ever. How about we choose some boxes and decide they, and only they, are stretchy? That way, our strategy to fully justify the text will be: stretch the stretchy bits on each row just enough so that the row is exactly the width we need. For the first time in a few lessons, we need to change our Box class: # lesson6.py\nclass Box(): def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1, stretchy=False): \"\"\"Accept arguments to define our box, and store them.\"\"\" self.x = x self.y = y self.w = w self.h = h self.stretchy = stretchy def __repr__(self): return 'Box(%s, %s, %s, %s)' % (self.x, self.y, self.w, self.y) # Many boxes with varying widths, and about 1 in 10 will be stretchy\nfrom random import randint many_boxes = [ Box(w=1 + randint(-5, 5) / 10, stretchy=(randint(0, 5) == 4)) for i in range(5000)\n]\n# A few pages all the same size\npages = [Box(i * 35, 0, 30, 50) for i in range(10)] The changes in the layout function are not so big. # lesson6.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .2 def layout(_boxes): # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy boxes = _boxes[:] # We start at page 0 page = 0 # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page previous = boxes.pop(0) previous.x = pages[page].x previous.y = pages[page].y row = [] while boxes: # We take the new 1st box box = boxes.pop(0) # And put it next to the other box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation # At the same vertical location box.y = previous.y # But if it's too far to the right... if (box.x + box.w) > (pages[page].x + pages[page].w): # We adjust the row slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - ( row[-1].x + row[-1].w ) When finishing a row, see if it has stretchy boxes in it.

Let's hit the issues in order. First, newlines. The idea is: if we find a newline, we need to break the line. Doesn't sound particularly complex, specially since lines that are broken intentionally are never fully justified. The changes are minor: Create a flag break_line set to True if we encounter a newline or overflow the page. In case of newline, make that box invisible by making it 0-wide and not stretchy.

In order to turn it into a real program we need to figure out what we want it to be. Then we will take our wish and make it happen. Easy, right? We have the following things: Code to generate text \"boxes\" representing a given text file. Code to generate a series of pages. Code to lay the text boxes in the pages. Code to draw text boxes and pages in a SVG. How can we combine those assets into a working, functional piece of software? Because I am old my first idea is to create a command line tool. We can explore others later, but this one is easy. It takes the name of a text file as first argument, and the name of a SVG file as second argument and it creates the second with the contents of the first. My favorite to do this is using docopt , where we will describe how the tool works and it turns the documentation into actual working code. It's serious overkill for what we want now, but we may grow into it. We will start with an empty file and then add all the bits of code we have until it works. Here's a first draft: \"\"\"\nUsage: boxes <input> <output> boxes --version\n\"\"\" from docopt import docopt # __name__ is the name of the current module. If it's called as a\n# script, it will be '__main__'\nif __name__ == '__main__': # If we are called as a script, call docopt. # __doc__ is that big string at the beginning of the file. arguments = docopt(__doc__, version='Boxes 0.12') # Print whatever docopt gives us print(arguments) And here is how that works. If we call it with two arguments, we get the information in arguments : $ python boxes.py foo bar {'--version': False, '<input>': 'foo', '<output>': 'bar'} If we were missing one, then we are using it wrong, and it will complain and print the help. $ python boxes.py foo Usage: boxes <input> <output> boxes --version And if we pass --version ? $ python boxes.py foo Boxes 0.12 So, we have a dictionary with input and output as keys. That is handy. All we need to do is slap our existing code in this script and make it use those names. Because I don't want to show you a wall of code, I am going to just highlight some snippets. You can see the whole change in our diff page Some of that code needs to be moved into proper functions: # boxes.py\ndef create_text_boxes(input_file): p_and_p = open(input_file).read() p_and_p = insert_soft_hyphens(p_and_p) # Insert invisible hyphens text_boxes = [] for l in p_and_p: text_boxes.append(Box(letter=l, stretchy=l == ' ')) adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes) return text_boxes def create_pages(): # A few pages all the same size pages = [Box(i * 35, 0, 30, 50) for i in range(10)] return pages We need to have pages be an argument to some functions instead of being a global variable: # boxes.py\ndef layout(_boxes, pages): # boxes.py\ndef draw_boxes(boxes, pages, fname, size, hide_boxes=False): And of course, we need to write a new function that calls everything in the right order with the right arguments: # boxes.py\ndef convert(input, output): pages = create_pages() text_boxes = create_text_boxes(input) layout(text_boxes, pages) draw_boxes(text_boxes, pages, output, (100, 50), True) if __name__ == '__main__': arguments = docopt(__doc__, version='Boxes 0') convert(input=arguments['<input>'], output=arguments['<output>']) And if we run it like this: $ python boxes.py pride-and-prejudice.txt lesson1.svg It will give us this output: lesson1.svg Further references: Full source code for this lesson code.py Difference with code from last lesson"},"part2/lesson0.run.html#setup":{"id":"part2/lesson0.run.html#setup","title":"Setup","body":"","breadcrumbs":"Part 2: Ducks in a Row » Setup"},"intro.html#how-the-book-is-built":{"breadcrumbs":"How the book is built","body":"It's written in markdown The sections with code are fed to pyliterate and its output is built into a \"book\" by mdbook The code uses a ton of things, links are provided in the Dependencies Appendix All the code and text for the book is available in a gitlab repo and it's published and updated at https://ralsina.gitlab.io","title":"How the book is built","id":"intro.html#how-the-book-is-built"},"part1/lesson5.run.html#boxes-v05":{"id":"part1/lesson5.run.html#boxes-v05","title":"BOXES v0.5","breadcrumbs":"Part 1: Finger Thinking » BOXES v0.5","body":"In our previous lesson we created code that can fill a series of pages using many small boxes.

You surely have seen things like it when using word processors or reading web pages, where the text is all aligned on the left and all ragged on the right. It's called a \"left-aligned\" or \"ragged-right\" layout. The reason is that we exceed the page width by a random amount, and then, when moving that box to the next row, we are left a random amount short of the desired width. Could we make it look aligned on BOTH sides? Of course. Let's try.

Some of my most fun projects were created because I was doing the equivalent of doodling on a computer. Sometimes, it starts with a post on a blog, or a link on twitter, and I just think \"hmmm, I wonder how that's done\" or \"well, that sounds fun to write\" or \"that doesn't look so hard!\" (those usually are so hard.) So, I doodle on the interpreter, or in a throwaway script file. No tests, no requirements, no fuzz.

Some hints of a direction were visible, like organizing our boxes in pages and trying to achieve a justified layout among others. So, let's just say it, we are going to be doing text layout. But not the easy one. No, sir. No monospaced fonts for us. We want to do the whole enchilada, we are going to have variable-width fonts with kerning, and multi-page, fully-justified text layouts with hyphenation . Ok, perhaps about 50% of the enchilada, because it will have no bidirectional support, only wok in english, only read UTF-8 encoded files, and so on a lot of things. But it's still a lot of mexican food! And we are going to do that in lessons not much longer than the ones you have been seeing so far. Except this one. This one is much longer. So let's get started. Clearly, we want our boxes to have letters. And our \"stretchy\" boxes are special because they have things like spaces. In fact, let's just say they have spaces. We will now expand our Box class to support letters inside the boxes. # lesson7.py\nclass Box(): def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1, stretchy=False, letter='x'): \"\"\"Accept arguments to define our box, and store them.\"\"\" self.x = x self.y = y self.w = w self.h = h self.stretchy = stretchy self.letter = letter def __repr__(self): return 'Box(%s, %s, %s, %s, \"%s\")' % ( self.x, self.y, self.w, self.y, self.letter ) # Many boxes, all the same width, with an x in them\ntext_boxes = [Box() for i in range(5000)] # A few pages all the same size\npages = [Box(i * 35, 0, 30, 50) for i in range(10)] We can keep using the exact same layout function. # lesson7.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .05 def layout(_boxes): # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy boxes = _boxes[:] # We start at page 0 page = 0 # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page previous = boxes.pop(0) previous.x = pages[page].x previous.y = pages[page].y row = [] while boxes: # We take the new 1st box box = boxes.pop(0) # And put it next to the other box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation # At the same vertical location box.y = previous.y # But if it's too far to the right... if (box.x + box.w) > (pages[page].x + pages[page].w): # We adjust the row slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - ( row[-1].x + row[-1].w ) # Get a list of all the ones that are stretchy stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy] if not stretchies: # Nothing stretches do as before. bump = slack / len(row) # The 1st box gets 0 bumps, the 2nd gets 1 and so on for i, b in enumerate(row): b.x += bump * i else: bump = slack / len(stretchies) # Each stretchy gets wider for b in stretchies: b.w += bump # And we put each thing next to the previous one for j, b in enumerate(row[1:], 1): b.x = row[j - 1].x + row[j - 1].w + separation # We start a new row row = [] # We go all the way left and a little down box.x = pages[page].x box.y = previous.y + previous.h + separation # But if we go too far down if box.y + box.h > pages[page].y + pages[page].h: # We go to the next page page += 1 # And put the box at the top-left box.x = pages[page].x box.y = pages[page].y # Put the box in the row row.append(box) previous = box layout(text_boxes) And tweak the drawing function to show us letters, and to make the colored boxes optional. # lesson7.py\nimport svgwrite def draw_boxes(boxes, fname, size, hide_boxes=False): dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(fname, profile='full', size=size) # Draw the pages for page in pages: dwg.add( dwg.rect( insert=(page.x, page.y), size=(page.w, page.h), fill='lightblue', ) ) # Draw all the boxes for box in boxes: # The box color depends on its features color = 'green' if box.stretchy else 'red' # Make the colored boxes optional if not hide_boxes: dwg.add( dwg.rect( insert=(box.x, box.y), size=(box.w, box.h), fill=color, ) ) # Display the letter in the box if box.letter: dwg.add( dwg.text( box.letter, insert=(box.x, box.y + box.h), font_size=box.h, font_family='Arial', ) ) dwg.save() draw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson7.svg', (30, 20)) lesson7.svg Of course this is very boring, so we need to spice up our data a little.

But as a text layout engine we have a major failure: we are ignoring the size of the letters we are layouting! This is a very complex thing to do called text shaping . You need to understand the content of the font you are using to display the text, and more subtle things like what happens if you put specific letters next to each other (kerning) and much more. The good news is that it's already done for us, in libraries called Harfbuzz and Freetype. This paragraph is perhaps the most important one in this book. I am about to show you some obscure code. And I will tell you the secret of how it got here: I copied it from the documentation for the libraries I am using. Sometimes you will need to do something complicated only once in your life. It's perfectly ok to just google how to do it. And as long as you are confident you can find it again if needed, it's ok to just forget about it. I will show you this code, and then put it in a separate file called fonts.py and from now on I will not show it in the lessons, because we are not going to change it, ever . # fonts.py\nimport harfbuzz as hb\nimport freetype2 as ft def adjust_widths_by_letter(boxes): \"\"\"Takes a list of boxes as arguments, and uses harfbuzz to adjust the width of each box to match the harfbuzz text shaping.\"\"\" buf = hb.Buffer.create() buf.add_str(''.join(b.letter for b in boxes)) buf.guess_segment_properties() font_lib = ft.get_default_lib() face = font_lib.find_face('Arial') face.set_char_size(size=1, resolution=64) font = hb.Font.ft_create(face) hb.shape(font, buf) # at this point buf.glyph_positions has all the data we need for box, position in zip(boxes, buf.glyph_positions): box.w = position.x_advance And now we will pretend we know what that does, based on its docstring and use it. # lesson7.py\nfrom code import fonts separation = .05\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson7_adjusted_letters.svg', (30, 20)) lesson7_adjusted_letters.svg And nicer, without the boxes: # lesson7.py\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes( text_boxes, 'lesson7_adjusted_letters_no_boxes.svg', (30, 20), hide_boxes=True,\n) lesson7_adjusted_letters_no_boxes.svg And of course, we can just load text there instead of random letters. For example, here we load what is going to be our example test from now on, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice from Project Gutenberg # lesson7.py\np_and_p = open('pride-and-prejudice.txt').read()\ntext_boxes = []\nfor l in p_and_p: text_boxes.append(Box(letter=l, stretchy=l == ' '))\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes( text_boxes, 'lesson7_pride_and_prejudice.svg', (30, 20), hide_boxes=True,\n) lesson7_pride_and_prejudice.svg And that is ... maybe disappointing? While we spent a lot of time on things like justifying text, we have not even looked at newlines! Also, spaces at the end of lines make the line appear ragged again, now that they are not boxes. So, we know what to hit in the next lesson.

White space at the beginning of rows is shown and it looks bad lesson8.svg You can see clearly, in the previous sample output where this happens in one of the latter paragraphs, \"to see the place, \" appears ragged when it should not. And a similar thing happens in an earlier paragraph where there is a hole against the left margin in \" told me all about it\". In both cases, the cause is because the \"empty\" space is used by spaces! So, one possible solution is, when justifying a row, to make all the spaces at the right margins 0-width and not stretchy. At the same time, when adding spaces at the beginning of a row, they should become 0-width and not stretchy. BUT this means the list of boxes will need its width readjusted if they are to be layouted again on different pages! That's because some of the spaces will now be thin and \"rigid\" so they will work badly if they are not against the margin on a different layout. It's not a big problem, but it's worth keeping in mind, since it's the kind of thing that becomes an obscure bug later on.

Specifically, some spaces will become 0-width and not stretchy. \"\"\" # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy boxes = _boxes[:] # We start at page 0 page = 0 # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page previous = boxes.pop(0) previous.x = pages[page].x previous.y = pages[page].y row = [] while boxes: # We take the new 1st box box = boxes.pop(0) # And put it next to the other box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation # At the same vertical location box.y = previous.y # Handle breaking on newlines break_line = False # But if it's a newline if (box.letter == '\\n'): break_line = True # Newlines take no horizontal space ever box.w = 0 box.stretchy = False # Or if it's too far to the right, and is a # good place to break the line... elif (box.x + box.w) > ( pages[page].x + pages[page].w ) and box.letter in ( ' ', '\\xad' ): if box.letter == '\\xad': # Add a visible hyphen in the row h_b = hyphenbox() h_b.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation h_b.y = previous.y _boxes.append(h_b) # So it's drawn row.append(h_b) # So it's justified break_line = True # We adjust the row # Remove all right-margin spaces while row[-1].letter == ' ': row.pop() slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - ( row[-1].x + row[-1].w ) # Get a list of all the ones that are stretchy stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy] if not stretchies: # Nothing stretches do as before. bump = slack / len(row) # The 1st box gets 0 bumps, the 2nd gets 1 and so on for i, b in enumerate(row): b.x += bump * i else: bump = slack / len(stretchies) # Each stretchy gets wider for b in stretchies: b.w += bump # And we put each thing next to the previous one for j, b in enumerate(row[1:], 1): b.x = row[j - 1].x + row[j - 1].w + separation if break_line: # We start a new row row = [] # We go all the way left and a little down box.x = pages[page].x box.y = previous.y + previous.h + separation # But if we go too far down if box.y + box.h > pages[page].y + pages[page].h: # We go to the next page page += 1 # And put the box at the top-left box.x = pages[page].x box.y = pages[page].y # Put the box in the row row.append(box) # Collapse all left-margin space if all(b.letter == ' ' for b in row): box.w = 0 box.stretchy = False box.x = pages[page].x previous = box layout(text_boxes) # lesson10.py\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson10.svg', (30, 50), hide_boxes=True) lesson10.svg And there in \"proper-ty\" you can see it in action. Of course this is a naïve implementation. What happens if you just can't break? many_boxes = [Box(letter='a') for i in range(200)]\nadjust_widths_by_letter(many_boxes)\nlayout(many_boxes)\ndraw_boxes(many_boxes, 'lesson10_lots_of_a.svg', (35, 6), hide_boxes=True) lesson10_lots_of_a.svg Since it can't break at all, it just goes on and on. And there are other corner cases! many_boxes = [Box(letter='a') for i in range(200)]\nmany_boxes[100] = Box(letter=' ', stretchy=True)\nadjust_widths_by_letter(many_boxes)\nlayout(many_boxes)\ndraw_boxes(many_boxes, 'lesson10_one_break.svg', (35, 6), hide_boxes=True) lesson10_one_break.svg Because there is only one place to break the line, it then tries to wedge 100 letter \"a\" where there is room for 54 (I counted!) and something interesting happens... the \"slack\" is negative! Instead of stretching out a \"underfilled\" line, we are squeezing a \"overfilled\" one. Everything gets packed too tight, and the letters start overlapping one another. The lesson is that just because it works for the usual case it doesn't mean it's done . Even in the case of words, it can happen that breaking points take a while to appear and our line becomes overfull. We will tackle that problem next.

Or rather, to show you something. What did we get for our trouble? Some ideas about how to lay down text on a page. A rough implementation of such ideas. A specific thing our implementation can't do (yet) An idea of how it could do it. And, the real goal: A process. What do I mean by \"a process\"? A way to work, to turn an idea into code. Sure, our process seems to be limited to \"write stuff down\", but in truth it's slightly more than that. Here it is in more detail: Start with a silly version of what you want and make it work. lesson1.svg Keep a copy of that thing, and think of a way to make it less silly. lesson2.svg Iterate point 2 until it sort of looks like what you really want, and not silly. Always keep track of the improvement. lesson6.svg Try to make it do what you really want, and notice the problems and unstated assumptions. lesson7.svg Iterate point 4 until it starts doing what you want it to do. lesson7_pride_and_prejudice.svg Apply yourself to make it do things well lesson10.svg Iterate point 6 until you reach a point of diminishing returns, where improving the code is too hard. We are now at that point, and the process needs a tweak. We need to start doing things in a different way. Just hacking it won't cut it. That is not a small thing. A vast majority of people who try to learn coding on their own never get this far. And while in the rest of the book we will be working on ways to make what we have now better , what we have is fine . For many people this is as far as your coding needs to take you. You can just take your knowledge of the language syntax, a desire to play with it and a problem and ride those things into a working solution that will do what you need . I am being deadly serious here. It's possible that you can just stop here. In fact, maybe you should go, grab the problem that has lead you into trying to learn to code, and just play for a while . Go, doodle, build something useful. Create a script that automates something you want. Use the approach I showed you and just build something. The rest of the book will still be here if you ever need to level up. And if you are ready to go on, then let's go.","id":"part1/recap.html#recapitulation","breadcrumbs":"Part 1: Finger Thinking » Recapitulation"},"part1/lesson0.run.html#setup":{"title":"SETUP","breadcrumbs":"Part 1: Finger Thinking » SETUP","body":"","id":"part1/lesson0.run.html#setup"},"part2/ducks_in_a_row.html#part-2-ducks-in-a-row":{"body":"In Part 1 of this book we worked on a text layout engine. That is, code that knows how and where letters from a text go in a page. It's not a great engine, it is far from perfect, but it's the one we've got and for the purposes of this book, I like it. We built it by experimenting. However, after a while, it got to the point where things are too complicated to add. We have an idea on how to do the next step, but I (really, I) am not confident I can do it without throwing away all the code and starting over. Which is why, yes, we will throw most of that code away. But we will do it in a very specific, controlled manner, and we will end up with a much better thing in its place, without ever breaking it. Welcome to the world of refactoring and testing. First, we will turn our ball of code into a organized whole, then we will learn how to use a tool called pytest and through it how to do incremental improvements with confidence and radical changes without fear.
