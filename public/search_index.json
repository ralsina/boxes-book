book tries to achieve only one thing:\nShow you a project go from nothing to OK.\nBy nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No\ngoals, no commitments. Just a vague interest.\nAnd by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to\nuse, it will be useful and be a real thing.\nThink of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only\ninstead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead\nof a band there is a piece of software.\nSo, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.\nTarget Audience\nTo get the most benefit from this book I expect the reader to have a basic\nknowledge of the Python programming language. Knowing and\nunderstanding the contents of the official\nPython Tutorial. should be enough to be\nable to follow all the code in the book, which has been kept as simple as\npossible.\nReaders with deeper knowledge of the language or more extensive programming\nexperience may still benefit from it but will find a lot of the first part\nboring.\nRequirements\nYou can try to follow the book by just reading it but that is probably not the\nbest idea. Actually running the example code is educational. Modifying it\neven more so.\nSo, you will need a working python interpreter.\nThe examples have only been tested on Linux. I suppose before calling this\nbook \"finished\" I will have to make them work on Windows and/or OS X somehow.\nEach one of the larger parts of the book requires a separate development\nenvironment and has a \"Chapter 0\" about setting it up.\n\nHow the book is built\n\nIt's written in markdown\nThe sections with code are fed to pyliterate and its output is built into a \"book\" by mdbook\nThe code uses a ton of things, links are provided in the Dependencies Appendix\nAll the code and text for the book is available in a gitlab repo and it's published and updated at https://ralsina.gitlab.io\n\n\n"},"part1/finger_thinking.html":{"url":"part1/finger_thinking.html","title":"Part 1: Finger Thinking","keywords":"","body":"Finger Thinking\nThis is the first part of the book, and the goal is starting a project from scratch. This happens in the beginning of many programming books, but I have\nthis feeling that they are lying to me.\nThe code seems rehearsed, there are no errors, everything progresses monotonically towards a lovely pyramid of code with no false starts and no wrong assumptions.\nIn the decades I have programmed, that has never happened to me. Not once. So, I guess those \"start from scratch\" things are actually done backwards, from\nthe working butterfly into a fake larva, or they are much better at this than I. Since I am not that awful a programmer, I have decided to believe the former, and take a shot at doing it the opposite way.\nEverything you see here is in the order I wrote it. I have, occasionally, gone back and cleaned up a bad idea, but trust me, there are plenty still left.\n\nSometimes, when you start a project, you will find that you don't have a clear goal. Some of my most fun projects were created because I was doing the equivalent of doodling on a computer.\nSometimes, it starts with a post on a blog, or a link on twitter, and I just think \"hmmm, I wonder how that's done\" or \"well, that sounds fun to write\" or\n\"that doesn't look so hard!\" (those usually are so hard.)\nSo, I doodle on the interpreter, or in a throwaway script file. No tests, no\nrequirements, no fuzz.\nThe first part of this book is, then, an iterative doodle, showing the infancy of a project, and almost literally thinking with my fingers, and having them tell me where to go.\nIn later sections, things will get much more serious. So, enjoy this part.\n"},"part1/lesson0.run.html":{"url":"part1/lesson0.run.html","title":"Setup","keywords":"","body":"SETUP\n"},"part1/lesson1.run.html":{"url":"part1/lesson1.run.html","title":"Lesson 1","keywords":"","body":"BOXES v0.1\nWelcome to Boxes v1. I want to be able to draw some boxes. By boxes I don't mean actual boxes,\nbut rather squares. I found a library called svgwrite that lets you do that pretty easily.\nFirst let's create a data structure. A simple class called Box.\n# lesson1.py\nclass Box():\n\n    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1):\n        \"\"\"Accept arguments to define our box, and store them.\"\"\"\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.w = w\n        self.h = h\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return 'Box(%s, %s, %s, %s)' % (self.x, self.y, self.w, self.y)\n\nAs you can see that is a pretty simple class. And we can create a big box.\nbig_box = Box(0, 0, 80, 100)\n\nOr many boxes using a list comprehension\n# lesson1.py\nmany_boxes = [Box() for i in range(5000)]\n\nSo now we have a big box, and 5000 smaller boxes, all alike.\n# Print the first 10 boxes\nprint(many_boxes[:10])\n\n[Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0), Box(0, 0, 1, 0)]\nAnd yes, we can draw those boxes.\n# lesson1.py\nimport svgwrite\n\n\ndef draw_boxes(boxes, fname, size):\n    dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(fname, profile='full', size=size)\n    # Draw all the boxes\n    for box in boxes:\n        dwg.add(\n            dwg.rect(\n                insert=(box.x, box.y), size=(box.w, box.h), fill='red'\n            )\n        )\n    dwg.save()\n\n\ndraw_boxes(many_boxes, 'lesson1.svg', (5, 2))\n\nAnd here is the output:\n\nThat ... was not very interesting. It's a single small red square!\nRemember all our boxes have the same size and position!\nSo ... we should do something better. Or at least more interesting, in lesson 2.\n\nFurther references:\n\nFull source code for this lesson: lesson1.py\n\n"},"part1/lesson2.run.html":{"url":"part1/lesson2.run.html","title":"Lesson 2","keywords":"","body":"BOXES v0.2\nIn our previous lesson we created a rather disappointing \ndrawing using boxes.

Floating point\nnumbers are weird.\nprint([(box.x, box.y) for box in many_boxes[:10]])\n\n[(0.0, 0), (1.2, 0), (2.4, 0), (3.5999999999999996, 0), (4.8, 0), (6.0, 0), (7.199999999999999, 0), (8.4, 0), (9.6, 0), (10.799999999999999, 0)]\nLet's draw them!\n# lesson2.py\nimport svgwrite\n\n\ndef draw_boxes(boxes, fname, size):\n    dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(fname, profile='full', size=size)\n    # Draw all the boxes\n    for box in boxes:\n        dwg.add(\n            dwg.rect(\n                insert=(box.x, box.y), size=(box.w, box.h), fill='red'\n            )\n        )\n    dwg.save()\n\n\ndraw_boxes(many_boxes, 'lesson2.svg', (5, 2))\n\nAnd here is the output:\n\nThat was more or less what we expected, right?

Just so we are sure we are staying inside the \nbig box, we will draw it too, in light blue.\n# lesson3.py\nimport svgwrite\n\n\ndef draw_boxes(boxes, fname, size):\n    dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(fname, profile='full', size=size)\n    # Draw the \"big box\"\n    dwg.add(\n        dwg.rect(\n            insert=(big_box.x, big_box.y),\n            size=(big_box.w, big_box.h),\n            fill='lightblue',\n        )\n    )\n    # Draw all the boxes\n    for box in boxes:\n        dwg.add(\n            dwg.rect(\n                insert=(box.x, box.y), size=(box.w, box.h), fill='red'\n            )\n        )\n    dwg.save()\n\n\n# Make the visible part of the drawing larger to show big_box\ndraw_boxes(many_boxes, 'lesson3.svg', (50, 90))\n\nAnd here is the output:\n\nThat is strangely satisfying! Of course we are doing something wrong in that\nwe are overflowing the big box vertically.\nSo, we could have more than one big box.

Once the boxes had different widths, the right side of our layout got all ragged. You surely have seen things like it when using word processors or reading web pages, where the text is all aligned on the left and all ragged on the right. It's called a \"left-aligned\" or \"ragged-right\" layout. \nThe reason is that we exceed the page width by a random amount, and then,\nwhen moving that box to the next row, we are left a random amount short of the desired width.\nCould we make it look aligned on BOTH sides?

But we cheated.\nTo achieve full justification, we spread the \"slack\" evenly in the space between all boxes in the row. If we were trying to layout text, that is not the proper way.\nYou see, text comes separated in words. And usually, in western languages, the words have characters called spaces between them. So what we do, when laying out text, is to make the special space boxes slightly larger and keep the separation between boxes constant (in fact, we also tweak separations between letters, but let's ignore that for now.

In fact, let's just say they\nhave spaces.\nWe will now expand our Box class to support letters inside the boxes.\n# lesson7.py\nclass Box():\n\n    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1, stretchy=False, letter='x'):\n        \"\"\"Accept arguments to define our box, and store them.\"\"\"\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.w = w\n        self.h = h\n        self.stretchy = stretchy\n        self.letter = letter\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return 'Box(%s, %s, %s, %s, \"%s\")' % (\n            self.x, self.y, self.w, self.y, self.letter\n        )\n\n\n# Many boxes, all the same width, with an x in them\ntext_boxes = [Box() for i in range(5000)]\n\n# A few pages all the same size\npages = [Box(i * 35, 0, 30, 50) for i in range(10)]\n\nWe can keep using the exact same layout function.\n# lesson7.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .05\n\n\ndef layout(_boxes):\n    # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy\n    boxes = _boxes[:]\n    # We start at page 0\n    page = 0\n    # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page\n    previous = boxes.pop(0)\n    previous.x = pages[page].x\n    previous.y = pages[page].y\n    row = []\n    while boxes:\n        # We take the new 1st box\n        box = boxes.pop(0)\n        # And put it next to the other\n        box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation\n        # At the same vertical location\n        box.y = previous.y\n        # But if it's too far to the right...\n        if (box.x + box.w) > (pages[page].x + pages[page].w):\n            # We adjust the row\n            slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - (\n                row[-1].x + row[-1].w\n            )\n            # Get a list of all the ones that are stretchy\n            stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy]\n            if not stretchies:  # Nothing stretches do as before.\n                bump = slack / len(row)\n                # The 1st box gets 0 bumps, the 2nd gets 1 and so on\n                for i, b in enumerate(row):\n                    b.x += bump * i\n            else:\n                bump = slack / len(stretchies)\n                # Each stretchy gets wider\n                for b in stretchies:\n                    b.w += bump\n                # And we put each thing next to the previous one\n                for j, b in enumerate(row[1:], 1):\n                    b.x = row[j - 1].x + row[j - 1].w + separation\n\n\n            # We start a new row\n            row = []\n            # We go all the way left and a little down\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n            box.y = previous.y + previous.h + separation\n\n        # But if we go too far down\n        if box.y + box.h > pages[page].y + pages[page].h:\n            # We go to the next page\n            page += 1\n            # And put the box at the top-left\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n            box.y = pages[page].y\n\n        # Put the box in the row\n        row.append(box)\n        previous = box\n\n\nlayout(text_boxes)\n\nAnd tweak the drawing function to show us letters, and to make the colored\nboxes optional.\n# lesson7.py\nimport svgwrite\n\n\ndef draw_boxes(boxes, fname, size, hide_boxes=False):\n    dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(fname, profile='full', size=size)\n    # Draw the pages\n    for page in pages:\n        dwg.add(\n            dwg.rect(\n                insert=(page.x, page.y),\n                size=(page.w, page.h),\n                fill='lightblue',\n            )\n        )\n    # Draw all the boxes\n    for box in boxes:\n        # The box color depends on its features\n        color = 'green' if box.stretchy else 'red'\n        # Make the colored boxes optional\n        if not hide_boxes:\n            dwg.add(\n                dwg.rect(\n                    insert=(box.x, box.y),\n                    size=(box.w, box.h),\n                    fill=color,\n                )\n            )\n        # Display the letter in the box\n        if box.letter:\n            dwg.add(\n                dwg.text(\n                    box.letter,\n                    insert=(box.x, box.y + box.h),\n                    font_size=box.h,\n                    font_family='Arial',\n                )\n            )\n    dwg.save()\n\n\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson7.svg', (30, 20))\n\n\nOf course this is very boring, so we need to spice up our data a little. We\ncan use different letters, and then make the right ones stretchy. That is\neasy!\n# lesson7.py\nfrom random import choice\n\nfor box in text_boxes:\n    # More than one space so they appear often\n    box.letter = choice('     abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')\n    if box.letter == ' ':  # Spaces are stretchy\n        box.stretchy = True\n\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson7_different_letters.svg', (30, 20))\n\n\nAs you can see, there are very minor horizontal shifts and stretches, since\nall boxes are the same size.\nBut as a text layout engine we have a major failure: we are ignoring the\nsize of the letters we are laying out!\nThis is a very complex thing to do called text shaping. You need to\nunderstand the content of the font you are using to display the text, and more\nsubtle things like what happens if you put specific letters next to each other\n(kerning) and much more.\nThe good news is that it's already done for us, in libraries called Harfbuzz\nand Freetype.\nThis paragraph is perhaps the most important one in this book. I am about to\nshow you some obscure code. And I will tell you the secret of how it got here:\nI copied it from the documentation for the libraries I am using. Sometimes\nyou will need to do something complicated only once in your life. It's\nperfectly OK to just google how to do it. And as long as you are confident you\ncan find it again if needed, it's OK to just forget about it.\nI will show you this code, and then put it in a separate file called\nfonts.py and from now on I will not show it in the lessons, because we are\nnot going to change it, ever.\n# fonts.py\nimport harfbuzz as hb\nimport freetype2 as ft\n\n\ndef adjust_widths_by_letter(boxes):\n    \"\"\"Takes a list of boxes as arguments, and uses harfbuzz to\n    adjust the width of each box to match the harfbuzz text shaping.\"\"\"\n    buf = hb.Buffer.create()\n    buf.add_str(''.join(b.letter for b in boxes))\n    buf.guess_segment_properties()\n    font_lib = ft.get_default_lib()\n    face = font_lib.find_face('Arial')\n    face.set_char_size(size=1, resolution=64)\n    font = hb.Font.ft_create(face)\n    hb.shape(font, buf)\n    # at this point buf.glyph_positions has all the data we need\n    for box, position in zip(boxes, buf.glyph_positions):\n        box.w = position.x_advance\n\nAnd now we will pretend we know what that does, based on its docstring and use\nit.\n# lesson7.py\nfrom code import fonts\n\n\nseparation = .05\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson7_adjusted_letters.svg', (30, 20))\n\n\nAnd nicer, without the boxes:\n# lesson7.py\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes(\n    text_boxes,\n    'lesson7_adjusted_letters_no_boxes.svg',\n    (30, 20),\n    hide_boxes=True,\n)\n\n\nAnd of course, we can just load text there instead of random letters. For\nexample, here we load what is going to be our example test from now on, Jane\nAusten's Pride and Prejudice from Project Gutenberg\n# lesson7.py\np_and_p = open('pride-and-prejudice.txt').read()\ntext_boxes = []\nfor l in p_and_p:\n    text_boxes.append(Box(letter=l, stretchy=l == ' '))\nfonts.adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\nlayout(text_boxes)\ndraw_boxes(\n    text_boxes,\n    'lesson7_pride_and_prejudice.svg',\n    (30, 20),\n    hide_boxes=True,\n)\n\n\nAnd that is ... maybe disappointing? While we spent a lot of time on things\nlike justifying text, we have not even looked at newlines!\nAlso, spaces at the end of lines make the line appear ragged again, now that\nthey are not boxes.\nSo, we know what to hit in the next lesson.\n\nFurther references:\n\nFull source code for this lesson lesson7.py\nDifference with code from last lesson\n\n"},"part1/lesson8.run.html":{"url":"part1/lesson8.run.html","title":"Lesson 8","keywords":"","body":"BOXES v0.8\nIn the previous lesson we started using our layout engine to display text, and ran into some limitations.

Here is the image of our attempt at displaying \"Pride and Prejudice\":\n\nLet's count the problems:\n\nIt totally ignores newlines everywhere\nIt keeps spaces at the end of rows, making the right side ragged \n(see \"said his \" in the seventh line)\nWhite space at the beginning of rows is shown and it looks bad \n(see \" a neigh\" at the beginning of the fifth line)\nWords are split between lines haphazardly, but this is for later and leads\nto some serious code that needs its own lesson.\n\nLet's hit the issues in order. First, newlines.\nThe idea is: if we find a newline, we need to break the line. Doesn't sound\nparticularly complex, specially since lines that are broken intentionally\nare never fully justified.\nThe changes are minor:\n\nCreate a flag break_line set to True if we encounter a newline \nor overflow the page.\nIn case of newline, make that box invisible by making it 0-wide and \nnot stretchy.\nWhen the break_line flag is set, handle as usual by moving to the \nleft, etc.\n\n# lesson8.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .05\n\n\ndef layout(_boxes):\n    # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy\n    boxes = _boxes[:]\n    # We start at page 0\n    page = 0\n    # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page\n    previous = boxes.pop(0)\n    previous.x = pages[page].x\n    previous.y = pages[page].y\n    row = []\n    while boxes:\n        # We take the new 1st box\n        box = boxes.pop(0)\n        # And put it next to the other\n        box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation\n        # At the same vertical location\n        box.y = previous.y\n\n        # Handle breaking on newlines\n        break_line = False\n        # But if it's a newline\n        if (box.letter == '\\n'):\n            break_line = True\n            # Newlines take no horizontal space ever\n            box.w = 0\n            box.stretchy = False\n\n        # Or if it's too far to the right...\n        elif (box.x + box.w) > (pages[page].x + pages[page].w):\n            break_line = True\n            # We adjust the row\n            slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - (\n                row[-1].x + row[-1].w\n            )\n            # Get a list of all the ones that are stretchy\n            stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy]\n            if not stretchies:  # Nothing stretches do as before.\n                bump = slack / len(row)\n                # The 1st box gets 0 bumps, the 2nd gets 1 and so on\n                for i, b in enumerate(row):\n                    b.x += bump * i\n            else:\n                bump = slack / len(stretchies)\n                # Each stretchy gets wider\n                for b in stretchies:\n                    b.w += bump\n                # And we put each thing next to the previous one\n                for j, b in enumerate(row[1:], 1):\n                    b.x = row[j - 1].x + row[j - 1].w + separation\n\n\n        if break_line:\n            # We start a new row\n            row = []\n            # We go all the way left and a little down\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n            box.y = previous.y + previous.h + separation\n\n        # But if we go too far down\n        if box.y + box.h > pages[page].y + pages[page].h:\n            # We go to the next page\n            page += 1\n            # And put the box at the top-left\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n            box.y = pages[page].y\n\n        # Put the box in the row\n        row.append(box)\n        previous = box\n\n\nlayout(text_boxes)\n\nThe code changes are small, but the output now looks radically different.\n# lesson8.py\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson8.svg', (30, 50), hide_boxes=True)\n\n\n\nFurther references:\n\nFull source code for this lesson lesson8.py\nDifference with code from last lesson\n\n"},"part1/lesson9.run.html":{"url":"part1/lesson9.run.html","title":"Lesson 9","keywords":"","body":"BOXES v0.9\nIn the previous lesson we fixed the handling of newlines\nin our layout engine, and noticed a problem with spaces.

And a similar thing happens in an earlier paragraph where there is a hole against the left margin in \" told me all about it\".\nIn both cases, the cause is because the \"empty\" space is used by spaces!\nSo, one possible solution is, when justifying a row, to make all the spaces at the right margins 0-width and not stretchy. At the same time, when adding spaces at the beginning of a row, they should become 0-width and not stretchy.\nBUT this means the list of boxes will need its width readjusted if they are to be layouted again on different pages! That's because some of the spaces will now be thin and \"rigid\" so they will work badly if they are not against the margin on a different layout.\nIt's not a big problem, but it's worth keeping in mind, since it's the kind of thing that becomes an obscure bug later on.

It has many problems, but remember our goal is not to create\nthe best possible thing, this is an educational experience. The spit and\npolish will appear later on.\nBut there is a glaring problem, it breaks words in all the wrong places.\nExamples of it appear in almost every line of the output. So, how does one fix\nthat?\nThe traditional answer (and the one we will be using) is hyphenation, breaking\nwords between lines in the correct places.\nInstead of breaking anywhere, we will break only in the places where the rules of each language\nallow us to.\nJust as it happened with text shaping we are lucky to live\nin a moment in time when almost everything we need to do it right is already\nin place. In particular, we will use a library called Pyphen\nmostly because I already have used it in another project.\nAm I sure it's the best one? No. Do I know exactly how it does what it does?\nNo. I know enough to make it work, and it works well enough so for this\nstage in the life of this project that is more than enough. In fact, it takes\nthe rules for word-breaking from dictionaries provided by an Office Suite, so\nit does about as good a job as the dictionary does. It even supports\nsubtleties such as the differences between British and American English!\nHere's an example of how it works:\nimport pyphen\ndic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en_GB')\nprint('en_GB:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-'))\ndic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en_US')\nprint('en_US:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-'))\n\nen_GB: dic-tion-ary\nen_US: dic-tio-nary\nKeep in mind that this is not magic. If you feed it garbage, it will give you\ngarbage.\ndic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='es_ES')\nprint('es_ES:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-'))\n\nes_ES: dic-tio-na-ry\nWhere is it proper to break a line?\n\nOn a newline character\nOn a space\nOn a breaking point as defined by Pyphen\n\nOne of those things is not like the others. We have boxes with newlines in\nthem and we have boxes with spaces in them, but there are no boxes with\nbreaking points in them.\nBut we can add them! There is Unicode symbol for that:\n\nSOFT HYPHEN (SHY)\nThe soft hyphen serves as an\ninvisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break\nis allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the\ntext is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping at the end\nof a line.\n\nSo, if we insert them in all the right places, then we can use them to decide\nwhether we are at a suitable breaking point. We will put this in a file called\nhyphen.py\n# hyphen.py\nimport pyphen\n\ndic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en_US')\n\n\ndef insert_soft_hyphens(text, hyphen='\\xad'):\n    \"\"\"Insert the hyphen in breaking pointsaccording to the dictionary.\n\n    '\\xad' is the Soft Hyphen (SHY) character\n    \"\"\"\n    lines = []\n    for line in text.splitlines():\n        hyph_words = [\n            dic.inserted(word, hyphen) for word in line.split()\n        ]\n        lines.append(' '.join(hyph_words))\n    return '\\n'.join(lines)\n\nfrom code.hyphen import insert_soft_hyphens\n\nprint (insert_soft_hyphens('Roses are red\\nViolets are blue', '-'))\n\nRos-es are red\nVi-o-lets are blue\nSo, with this code ready, we can get to work on implementing hyphenation\nsupport in our layout function.\nFirst, this code is exactly as it was before:\n# lesson10.py\nfrom code.fonts import adjust_widths_by_letter\nfrom code.hyphen import insert_soft_hyphens\n\n\nclass Box():\n\n    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1, stretchy=False, letter='x'):\n        \"\"\"Accept arguments to define our box, and store them.\"\"\"\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.w = w\n        self.h = h\n        self.stretchy = stretchy\n        self.letter = letter\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return 'Box(%s, %s, %s, %s, \"%s\")' % (\n            self.x, self.y, self.w, self.y, self.letter\n        )\n\nWe do need to make a small change to how we load our text, to add the hyphens:\n# lesson10.py\np_and_p = open('pride-and-prejudice.txt').read()\np_and_p = insert_soft_hyphens(p_and_p)  # Insert invisible hyphens\ntext_boxes = []\nfor l in p_and_p:\n    text_boxes.append(Box(letter=l, stretchy=l == ' '))\nadjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\n\n# A few pages all the same size\npages = [Box(i * 35, 0, 30, 50) for i in range(10)]\n\nNo changes in how we draw things.\n# lesson10.py\nimport svgwrite\n\n\ndef draw_boxes(boxes, fname, size, hide_boxes=False):\n    dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(fname, profile='full', size=size)\n    # Draw the pages\n    for page in pages:\n        dwg.add(\n            dwg.rect(\n                insert=(page.x, page.y),\n                size=(page.w, page.h),\n                fill='lightblue',\n            )\n        )\n    # Draw all the boxes\n    for box in boxes:\n        # The box color depends on its features\n        color = 'green' if box.stretchy else 'red'\n        # Make the colored boxes optional\n        if not hide_boxes:\n            dwg.add(\n                dwg.rect(\n                    insert=(box.x, box.y),\n                    size=(box.w, box.h),\n                    fill=color,\n                )\n            )\n        # Display the letter in the box\n        if box.letter:\n            dwg.add(\n                dwg.text(\n                    box.letter,\n                    insert=(box.x, box.y + box.h),\n                    font_size=box.h,\n                    font_family='Arial',\n                )\n            )\n    dwg.save()\n\nAnd now our layout function. One first approach, which we will refine later,\nis to simply refuse to break lines if we are not in a \"good\" place to break it.\nThen, we inject a box with a visible hyphen in the line break, and that's it.\nHere is the code to create a box with a hyphen:\n# lesson10.py\ndef hyphenbox():\n    b = Box(letter='-')\n    adjust_widths_by_letter([b])\n    return b\n\nAnd here finally, our layout supports hyphens:\n# lesson10.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .05\n\n\ndef layout(_boxes):\n    \"\"\"Layout boxes along pages.\n\n    Keep in mind that this function modifies the boxes themselves, so\n    you should be very careful about trying to call layout() more than once\n    on the same boxes.\n\n    Specifically, some spaces will become 0-width and not stretchy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy\n    boxes = _boxes[:]\n    # We start at page 0\n    page = 0\n    # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page\n    previous = boxes.pop(0)\n    previous.x = pages[page].x\n    previous.y = pages[page].y\n    row = []\n    while boxes:\n        # We take the new 1st box\n        box = boxes.pop(0)\n        # And put it next to the other\n        box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation\n        # At the same vertical location\n        box.y = previous.y\n\n        # Handle breaking on newlines\n        break_line = False\n        # But if it's a newline\n        if (box.letter == '\\n'):\n            break_line = True\n            # Newlines take no horizontal space ever\n            box.w = 0\n            box.stretchy = False\n\n        # Or if it's too far to the right, and is a\n        # good place to break the line...\n        elif (box.x + box.w) > (\n            pages[page].x + pages[page].w\n        ) and box.letter in (\n            ' ', '\\xad'\n        ):\n            if box.letter == '\\xad':\n                # Add a visible hyphen in the row\n                h_b = hyphenbox()\n                h_b.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation\n                h_b.y = previous.y\n                _boxes.append(h_b)  # So it's drawn\n                row.append(h_b)  # So it's justified\n            break_line = True\n            # We adjust the row\n            # Remove all right-margin spaces\n            while row[-1].letter == ' ':\n                row.pop()\n            slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - (\n                row[-1].x + row[-1].w\n            )\n            # Get a list of all the ones that are stretchy\n            stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy]\n            if not stretchies:  # Nothing stretches do as before.\n                bump = slack / len(row)\n                # The 1st box gets 0 bumps, the 2nd gets 1 and so on\n                for i, b in enumerate(row):\n                    b.x += bump * i\n            else:\n                bump = slack / len(stretchies)\n                # Each stretchy gets wider\n                for b in stretchies:\n                    b.w += bump\n                # And we put each thing next to the previous one\n                for j, b in enumerate(row[1:], 1):\n                    b.x = row[j - 1].x + row[j - 1].w + separation\n\n\n        if break_line:\n            # We start a new row\n            row = []\n            # We go all the way left and a little down\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n            box.y = previous.y + previous.h + separation\n\n        # But if we go too far down\n        if box.y + box.h > pages[page].y + pages[page].h:\n            # We go to the next page\n            page += 1\n            # And put the box at the top-left\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n            box.y = pages[page].y\n\n        # Put the box in the row\n        row.append(box)\n\n        # Collapse all left-margin space\n        if all(b.letter == ' ' for b in row):\n            box.w = 0\n            box.stretchy = False\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n\n        previous = box\n\n\nlayout(text_boxes)\n\n# lesson10.py\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson10.svg', (30, 50), hide_boxes=True)\n\n\nAnd there in \"proper-ty\" you can see it in action.

If not, add to the line\nIf we broke the line, adjust positions and widths so the line is\nexactly as wide as the page by spreading the slack.\n\nWe need a better way to decide what is the best possible breaking point for\nthe line. If it's too overfull, it will look bad. If it's too underfull, it\nwill look bad too. And sometimes there is just no good breaking point and we\nneed to do something.\nIf we were lucky enough to have a breaking point that exactly fills the line,\nthen we would not have a problem, so usually this will come down to choosing\nbetween two breaking points. One makes the line overfull, one keeps it\nunderfull.\nHow good is a breaking point?\n\nIf the slack is smaller, it's better.\nIf it's underfull it's slightly better than overfull, since it's better to\nhave a spread out line than overlapping letters.\nIf we have many spaces, then a bigger slack is acceptable.\n\nThis is all subjective, of course. How much movement we tolerate on the text\nis a judgment call, so it involves some trial and error.\nLet's start with some made up numbers, because we have to start somewhere.\n\nThe allowed positive slack is 20% of the width of the spaces in the line.\nThe allowed negative slack is 10% of the width of the spaces in the line.\n\nAnd here's a plan to implement it:\n\nWhen adding characters, check if it's a possible breaking point.\nIf it is, remember the \"goodness\" it has\nWhen reaching an overfull breaking point, check if it's better than the last\none we saw.\nIf the overfull breaking point is better, break.\nIf the overfull breaking point is worse, use the underfull breaking point.\n\nThe first new thing is a function to calculate how good a breaking point is,\nin those terms.\n# lesson11.py\ndef badness(page_width, row):\n    \"\"\"Calculate how 'bad' a position to break is.\n\n    bigger is worse.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Yes, this is suboptimal. It's easier to optimize working code\n    # than fixing fast code.\n    row_width = (row[-1].x + row[-1].w) - row[0].x\n    slack = page_width - row_width\n    stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy]\n    if len(stretchies) > 0:\n        stretchies_width = sum(s.w for s in stretchies)\n        # More stetchy space is good. More slack is bad.\n        badness = slack / stretchies_width\n    else:  # Nothing to stretch. Not good.\n        badness = 1000\n    if slack \n# 10 boxes of width 1, 1 stretchy in the middle\nboxes = [Box(x=i, w=1) for i in range(10)]\nboxes[5].stretchy = True\n\n# On a page that is 8 units wide:\nprint(badness(8, boxes))\n\n-4.0\nLet's see how that works for page widths between 5 and 15 (remember our row is\n10 units wide):\nfor w in range(5,15):\n  print('page_width:', w, ' -> badness:', badness(w, boxes))\n\nAs you can see, if the page was 10 units wide, it would be optimal. The second\nbest option is for the page to be slightly wider, then maybe slightly thinner\nand so on.\npage_width: 5  -> badness: -10.0\npage_width: 6  -> badness: -8.0\npage_width: 7  -> badness: -6.0\npage_width: 8  -> badness: -4.0\npage_width: 9  -> badness: -2.0\npage_width: 10  -> badness: 0.0\npage_width: 11  -> badness: 1.0\npage_width: 12  -> badness: 2.0\npage_width: 13  -> badness: 3.0\npage_width: 14  -> badness: 4.0\nWe will need to load data that shows the problem. In this case, it's a row of\n20 letters 'a' (without hyphens), a space, then 20, and then 30 more 'a's.\nWhy?\nLike before, the page is about wide enough to fix 58 \"a\"s. That means the first\nrun will not be enough to fill the line. The second run will still not be\nenough. The third run will, however, badly overfill it. So, we should go all\nthe way to the end, see that it's too long, and then go back to the second\nspace and break there.\n# lesson11.py\n# Three runs of \"a\" with spaces between them.\n# The ideal breaking point is the second space.\ntext_boxes = [Box(letter='a') for a in range(72)]\nfor i in (20, 50):\n    text_boxes[i].letter = ' '\n    text_boxes[i].stretchy = True\nadjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)\n\n\n# A few pages all the same size\npages = [Box(i * 35, 0, 30, 50) for i in range(10)]\n\nAnd now we have a problem. The change to our code needed to implement that is\ntoo large. It's so large that it amounts to a rewrite of our layout function\nand if we rewrite it, how would we be sure that we are not breaking all the\nthings we achieved previously?\nIt turns out this is as far as just sitting down and writing code will take\nus. We need to get more serious, and transform this small pile of fragile code\ninto something we can actually hack confidently and transform without fear of\ndestroying it.\nTherefore, we leave layout intact, show the failing test and move on to\nPart 2 of the book, where we will reorganize the code into a coherent\nsoftware package and then... we will try again.\n# lesson11.py\n# We add a \"separation\" constant so you can see the boxes individually\nseparation = .05\n\n\ndef layout(_boxes):\n    \"\"\"Layout boxes along pages.\n\n    Keep in mind that this function modifies the boxes themselves, so\n    you should be very careful about trying to call layout() more than once\n    on the same boxes.\n\n    Specifically, some spaces will become 0-width and not stretchy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy\n    boxes = _boxes[:]\n    # We start at page 0\n    page = 0\n    # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page\n    previous = boxes.pop(0)\n    previous.x = pages[page].x\n    previous.y = pages[page].y\n    row = []\n    while boxes:\n        # We take the new 1st box\n        box = boxes.pop(0)\n        # And put it next to the other\n        box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation\n        # At the same vertical location\n        box.y = previous.y\n\n        # Handle breaking on newlines\n        break_line = False\n        # But if it's a newline\n        if (box.letter == '\\n'):\n            break_line = True\n            # Newlines take no horizontal space ever\n            box.w = 0\n            box.stretchy = False\n\n        # Or if it's too far to the right, and is a\n        # good place to break the line...\n        elif (box.x + box.w) > (\n            pages[page].x + pages[page].w\n        ) and box.letter in (\n            ' ', '\\xad'\n        ):\n            if box.letter == '\\xad':\n                # Add a visible hyphen in the row\n                h_b = hyphenbox()\n                h_b.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation\n                h_b.y = previous.y\n                _boxes.append(h_b)  # So it's drawn\n                row.append(h_b)  # So it's justified\n            break_line = True\n            # We adjust the row\n            # Remove all right-margin spaces\n            while row[-1].letter == ' ':\n                row.pop()\n            slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - (\n                row[-1].x + row[-1].w\n            )\n            # Get a list of all the ones that are stretchy\n            stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy]\n            if not stretchies:  # Nothing stretches do as before.\n                bump = slack / len(row)\n                # The 1st box gets 0 bumps, the 2nd gets 1 and so on\n                for i, b in enumerate(row):\n                    b.x += bump * i\n            else:\n                bump = slack / len(stretchies)\n                # Each stretchy gets wider\n                for b in stretchies:\n                    b.w += bump\n                # And we put each thing next to the previous one\n                for j, b in enumerate(row[1:], 1):\n                    b.x = row[j - 1].x + row[j - 1].w + separation\n\n\n        if break_line:\n            # We start a new row\n            row = []\n            # We go all the way left and a little down\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n            box.y = previous.y + previous.h + separation\n\n        # But if we go too far down\n        if box.y + box.h > pages[page].y + pages[page].h:\n            # We go to the next page\n            page += 1\n            # And put the box at the top-left\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n            box.y = pages[page].y\n\n        # Put the box in the row\n        row.append(box)\n\n        # Collapse all left-margin space\n        if all(b.letter == ' ' for b in row):\n            box.w = 0\n            box.stretchy = False\n            box.x = pages[page].x\n\n        previous = box\n\n\nlayout(text_boxes)\n\n# lesson11.py\ndraw_boxes(text_boxes, 'lesson11.svg', (33, 5), hide_boxes=True)\n\n\n\nFurther references:\n\nFull source code for this lesson lesson11.py\nDifference with code from last lesson\n\n"},"part1/recap.html":{"url":"part1/recap.html","title":"Recapitulation","keywords":"","body":"Recapitulation\nIf you are here, you have lived through 11 clumsy attempts at teaching you\nsomething.

In order\nto turn it into a real program we need to figure out what we want it to\nbe. Then we will take our wish and make it happen. Easy, right?\nWe have the following things:\n\nCode to generate text \"boxes\" representing a given text file.\nCode to generate a series of pages.\nCode to lay the text boxes in the pages.\nCode to draw text boxes and pages in a SVG.\n\nHow can we combine those assets into a working, functional piece of software?\nBecause I am old my first idea is to create a command line tool. We can\nexplore others later, but this one is easy. It takes the name of a text file\nas first argument, and the name of a SVG file as second argument and it\ncreates the second with the contents of the first.\nMy favorite to do this is using docopt,\nwhere we will describe how the tool works and it turns the documentation into\nactual working code. It's serious overkill for what we want now, but we may\ngrow into it.\nWe will start with an empty file and then add all the bits of code we have\nuntil it works.\nHere's a first draft:\n\"\"\"\nUsage:\n    boxes  \n    boxes --version\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom docopt import docopt\n\n\n# __name__ is the name of the current module. If it's called as a\n# script, it will be '__main__'\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # If we are called as a script, call docopt.\n    # __doc__ is that big string at the beginning of the file.\n    arguments = docopt(__doc__, version='Boxes 0.12')\n    # Print whatever docopt gives us\n    print(arguments)\n\nAnd here is how that works. If we call it with two arguments, we get the\ninformation in arguments:\n$ python boxes.py foo bar\n\n{'--version': False,\n '': 'foo',\n '': 'bar'}\n\nIf we were missing one, then we are using it wrong, and it will complain and\nprint the help.\n$ python boxes.py foo\n\nUsage:\n    boxes  \n    boxes --version\n\nAnd if we pass --version?\n$ python boxes.py foo\n\nBoxes 0.12\n\nSo, we have a dictionary with input and output as keys.

When you read the code, you\nshould be wrinkling your nose, like when you get sushi and it smells just a\nlittle bit off.

We are\ndeciding there are 10 pages , they are 30x50 and next to each other with a\nspecific separation.\nMagic numbers are bad because they encode a choice. They are literally us\nchoosing something and making it part of the code. By being inside the code,\nthey are outside the reach of the user. In some cases the magic numbers have a\ngood reason for existing. In others they should just be a default for\nsomething the user can change.\nThere are additional decisions not in numbers, such as using the Arial font,\nbut we will get around to them later.\nSo, let's get rid of the stench, and make those things part of the interface\nwe provide the user.\nLet's go in order.\nFor separation we can make an optional argument defaulting to that value.\nThe pages list, we could take a page size argument at least. And for the\ndrawing size, we will just make the drawing big enough to show all the boxes.\nA bit trickier is the number of pages, which was hardcoded to 10. We will just\ncreate a large number of pages and remove the unused ones.\nThe first two are just a matter of adding them to the docopt data. The parts\nbetween [] brackets are optional.\n# boxes.py\n\"\"\"\nUsage:\n    boxes   [--page-size=] [--separation=]\n    boxes --version\n\"\"\"\n\nThen getting the values out of the arguments (or use defaults), and pass them\nalong to our existing functions:\n# boxes.py\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    arguments = docopt(__doc__, version='Boxes 0.13')\n\n    if arguments['--page-size']:\n        p_size = [int(x) for x in arguments['--page-size'].split('x')]\n    else:\n        p_size = (30, 50)\n\n    if arguments['--separation']:\n        separation = float(arguments['--separation'])\n    else:\n        separation = 0.05\n\n\n    convert(\n        input=arguments[''],\n        output=arguments[''],\n        page_size=p_size,\n        separation=separation,\n    )\n\nAdding the arguments to convert and passing them along where they make sense.\nAdditionally, we calculate the drawing size instead of just hardcoding it.\n# boxes.py\ndef convert(input, output, page_size=(30, 50), separation=0.05):\n    pages = create_pages(page_size)\n    text_boxes = create_text_boxes(input)\n    layout(text_boxes, pages, separation)\n    draw_boxes(\n        text_boxes,\n        pages,\n        output,\n        (pages[-1].w + pages[-1].x, pages[-1].h),\n        True,\n    )\n\nAnd making the obvious changes in each function. In create_pages we use the\npage size:\n# boxes.py\ndef create_pages(page_size):\n    # A few pages all the same size\n    w, h = page_size\n    pages = [Box(i * (w + 5), 0, w, h) for i in range(1000)]\n    return pages\n\nIn layout we pass separation as argument, which requires no changes, and\nadd a little code to delete the unused pages:\n# boxes.py\n    # Remove leftover boxes\n    del (pages[page:])\n\nI suggest you take a close look at the diff for this lesson. to see all these small changes in context.\nWhat have we gained for this effort?
