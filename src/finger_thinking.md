# Finger Thinking

This is the first part of the book, and the goal is starting a project.
Sometimes, when you start a project, you will find that you don't have a clear goal. Some of my most fun projects were created because I was doing the equivalent of doodling on a computer.

Sometimes, it starts with a post on a blog, or a link on twitter, and I just think "hmmm, I wonder how that's done" or "well, that sounds fun to write" or
"that doesn't look so hard!" (those usually *are* so hard.)

So, I doodle on the interpreter, or in a throwaway script file. No tests, no
requirements, no fuzz. 

The first part is, then, an iterative doodle, showing the infancy of a project,
and almost literally thinking with my fingers, and having them tell me where to go.

In a later section, things will get much more serious. So, enjoy this part.
