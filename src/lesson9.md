# BOXES v9

In our [previous lesson](../lesson8.run.html) we created a serviceable text layout engine.
It has many problems, but remember our goal is not to create the best possible thing, this
is an educational experience. The spit and polish will appear later on.

But there is a glaring problem, it breaks words in all the wrong places. Examples of it
appear in almost every line of the output. So, how does one fix that?

The traditional answer (and the one we will be using) is hyphenation, breaking words
between lines in the correct places.

Instead of breaking anywhere, we will break only in the places where the [rules of each language](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/385/what-are-the-rules-for-splitting-words-at-the-end-of-a-line)
allow us to.

Just as it happened with [text shaping](./lesson7.run.html) we are lucky to live in a moment in time
when almost everything we need to do it right is already in place. In particular, we will use
a library called [Pyphen](https://github.com/Kozea/Pyphen) mostly because I already have used it
in another project.

Am I sure it's the best one? No. Do I know exactly how it does what it does? No. I know enough to make
it work, and it works *well enough* so for this stage in the life of this project that is more than
enough. In fact, it takes the rules for word-breaking from dictionaries provided by an Office Suite,
so it does about as good a job as the dictionary does. It even supports subtleties such as the
differences betwen British and American English!

Here's an example of how it works:

```python
import pyphen
dic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en_GB')
print('en_GB:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-'))
dic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en_US')
print('en_US:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-'))
```

```
Output goes here
```

Keep in mind that this is not magic. If you feed it garbage, it
will give you garbage.

```python
dic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='es_ES')
print('es_ES:', dic.inserted('dictionary', '-'))
```

```
Output goes here
```

Where is it proper to break a line?

* On a newline character
* On a space
* On a breaking point as defined by Pyphen

One of those things is not like the others. We have boxes with newlines in them and we have boxes with spaces in them, but there are no boxes with breaking points in them.

But we can add them! There is unicode symbol for that: [SOFT HYPHEN (SHY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_hyphen)

> It serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping at the end of a line.

So, if we insert them in all the right places, then we can use them to decide whether we are at a suitable breaking point.

```python

dic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en_US')

# '\xad' is the Soft Hyphen (SHY) character
def insert_soft_hyphens(text, hyphen='\xad'):
    """Insert the hyphen in breaking pointsaccording to the dictionary."""
    lines = []
    for line in text.splitlines():
        hyph_words = [dic.inserted(word, hyphen) for word in line.split()]
        lines.append(' '.join(hyph_words))
    return '\n'.join(lines)

print (insert_soft_hyphens('Roses are red\nViolets are blue', '-'))
```


```
Output goes here
```

So, with this code ready, we can get to work on implementing hyphenation support in our layout function.

First, this code is exactly as it was before:

```python

from fonts import adjust_widths_by_letter

class Box():
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1, stretchy=False, letter='x'):
        """We accept a few arguments to define our box, and we store them."""
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.w = w
        self.h = h
        self.stretchy = stretchy
        self.letter = letter

    def __repr__(self):
        """This is what is shown if we print a Box. We want it to be useful."""
        return 'Box(%s, %s, %s, %s, "%s")' % (self.x, self.y, self.w, self.y, self.letter)

# A few pages all the same size
pages = [Box(i * 35 + 1, 1, 30, 50) for i in range(10)]

import svgwrite

def draw_boxes(boxes, name='lesson9.svg', hide_boxes=False):
    dwg = svgwrite.Drawing(name, profile='full', size=(32, 22))
    for page in pages:
        dwg.add(dwg.rect(insert=(page.x, page.y), 
                size=(page.w, page.h), fill='lightyellow'))
    for box in boxes:
        color = 'green' if box.stretchy else 'red'
        if not hide_boxes:
            dwg.add(dwg.rect(insert=(box.x, box.y), size=(box.w, box.h), fill=color))
        if box.letter:
            dwg.add(dwg.text(box.letter, insert=(box.x, box.y + box.h), font_size=box.h, font_family='Arial'))
    dwg.save()
```

We do need to make a small change to how we load our text, to add the hyphens:

```python
p_and_p = open('pride-and-prejudice.txt').read()
p_and_p = insert_soft_hyphens(p_and_p)  # This is the new line
text_boxes = []
for l in p_and_p:
    text_boxes.append(Box(letter=l, stretchy=l==' '))
adjust_widths_by_letter(text_boxes)
```

And now our layout function. One first approach, which we will refine later,
is to simply refuse to break lines if we are not in a "good" place to break it.

Then, we inject a box with a visible hyphen in the linebreak, and that's it.

Here is the code to create a box with a hyphen:

```python
def hyphenbox():
    b = Box(letter='-')
    adjust_widths_by_letter([b])
    return b
```

And here finally, our layout supports hyphens:

```python
# We add a "separation" constant so you can see the boxes individually
separation = .05

def layout(_boxes):
    """Layout boxes along pages.

    Keep in mind that this function modifies the boxes themselves, so
    you should be very careful about trying to call layout() more than once
    on the same boxes.

    Specifically, some spaces will become 0-width and not stretchy.
    """

    # Because we modify the box list, we will work on a copy
    boxes = _boxes[:]
    # We start at page 0
    page = 0
    # The 1st box should be placed in the correct page
    previous = boxes.pop(0)
    previous.x = pages[page].x
    previous.y = pages[page].y
    row = []
    while boxes:
        # We take the new 1st box
        box = boxes.pop(0)
        # And put it next to the other
        box.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation
        # At the same vertical location
        box.y = previous.y

        # The next 10 lines are almost all the change
        break_line = False
        # But if it's a newline
        if (box.letter == '\n'):
            break_line = True
            # Newlines take no horizontal space ever
            box.w = 0
            box.stretchy = False

        # Or if it's too far to the right...
        elif (box.x + box.w) > (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) and box.letter in (' ', '\xad'):
            if box.letter == '\xad':
                # Add a visible hyphen in the row
                h_b = hyphenbox()
                h_b.x = previous.x + previous.w + separation
                h_b.y = previous.y
                _boxes.append(h_b)  # So it's drawn
                row.append(h_b) # So it's justified
            break_line = True
            # We adjust the row
            # Remove all right-margin spaces
            while row[-1].letter == ' ':
                row.pop()
            slack = (pages[page].x + pages[page].w) - (row[-1].x + row[-1].w)
            stretchies = [b for b in row if b.stretchy]
            if stretchies:
                bump = slack / len(stretchies)
                # Each stretchy gets wider
                for b in stretchies:
                    b.w += bump
                # And we put each thing next to the previous one
                for j, b in enumerate(row[1:], 1):
                    b.x = row[j-1].x + row[j-1].w + separation

            else:  # Nothing stretches!!! Do it like before.
                bump = slack / len(row)
                for i, b in enumerate(row):
                    b.x += bump * i

        if break_line:
            # We start a new row
            row = []
            # We go all the way left and a little down
            box.x = pages[page].x
            box.y = previous.y + previous.h + separation

        # But if we go too far down
        if box.y + box.h > pages[page].y + pages[page].h:
            # We go to the next page
            page += 1
            # And put the box at the top-left
            box.x = pages[page].x
            box.y = pages[page].y

        # Put the box in the row
        row.append(box)

        # Collapse all left-margin space
        if all(b.letter == ' ' for b in row):
            box.w = 0
            box.stretchy = False
            box.x = pages[page].x

        previous = box

layout(text_boxes)
draw_boxes(text_boxes, hide_boxes=True)
```

<img src="lesson9.svg" width="100%" style='border: 1px solid green; overflow: auto;'>

And there in "proper-ty" you can see it in action. Of course this is 
a na√Øve implementation. What happens if you just can't break?

```python
many_boxes = [Box(letter='a') for i in range(200)]
adjust_widths_by_letter(many_boxes)
layout(many_boxes)
draw_boxes(many_boxes, hide_boxes=True, name='lesson9_lots_of_a.svg')
```

<img src="lesson9_lots_of_a.svg" width="100%" style='border: 1px solid green; overflow: auto;'>

Since it can't break at all, it just goes on and on.

And there are other corner cases!

```python
many_boxes = [Box(letter='a') for i in range(200)]
many_boxes[100] = Box(letter=' ', stretchy=True)
adjust_widths_by_letter(many_boxes)
layout(many_boxes)
draw_boxes(many_boxes, hide_boxes=True, name='lesson9_one_break.svg')
```

<img src="lesson9_one_break.svg" width="100%" style='border: 1px solid green; overflow: auto;'>

Because there is only one place to break the line, it then tries to 
wedge 100 letter "a" where there is room for 54 (I counted!) and something interesting happens... the "slack" is negative!

Instead of stretching out a "underfilled" line, we are squeezing a "overfilled" one. Everything gets packed too tight, and the letters start
overlapping one another.

The lesson is that just because it works for the usual case it doesn't mean
it's **done**. Even in the case of words, it can happen that breaking points take a while to appear and our line becomes overfull.

We will tackle that problem next.
