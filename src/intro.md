# Introduction

This book tries to achieve only one thing:

Show you a project go from **nothing** to **good**.

By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no committments. Just a vague interest.

And by good I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be **useful** and be a real thing.

Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software.

So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.

# How it's done

* It's written in markdown
* The sections with code are fed to [pyliterate](https://github.com/bslatkin/pyliterate) and its output is built into a "book" by [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook)
* The code uses a ton of things, links are provided in the [Dependencies Appendix](./dependencies.html)
