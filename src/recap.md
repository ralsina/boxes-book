# Recapitulation

If you are here, you have lived through 11 clumsy attempts at teaching you
something. Or rather, to *show* you something.

What did we get for our trouble?

* Some ideas about how to lay down text on a page.
* A rough implementation of such ideas.
* A specific thing our implementation can't do (yet)
* An idea of how it *could* do it.

That is not a small thing. A vast majority of people who try to learn
coding on their own never get this far. And while in the rest of the book we will be working on ways to make what we have now *better*, what we have is *fine*.

For many people this is as far as your coding needs to take you. You can just
take your knowledge of the language syntax, a desire to play with it and a
problem and ride those things into a working solution that will *do what you need*.

I am being deadly serious here. It's possible that you can just stop here.
In fact, maybe you should go, grab the problem that has lead you into trying to learn to code, and just *play for a while*.

Go, doodle, build something useful. Create a script that automates something you want. Use the approach I showed you and just build something.

The rest of the book will still be here if you ever need to level up.

And if you are ready to go on, then let's go.
